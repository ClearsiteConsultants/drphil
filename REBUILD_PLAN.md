#### Meet the Doctor Section
**Heading:** "Meet the Doctor"

**Doctor Name:** "Dr. Phil Wilkins DC ATC CNIM"

**Biography:**
"I have always loved being active and participated in sports throughout my life. My journey in healthcare began when I severely injured my ankle and had to have surgery to repair ligament and tendon damage. Starting rehab for my ankle I knew I wanted to help people overcome their injuries and become healthier. I found through that experience that I loved the human body and how it worked and had a real knack for it. This led to me earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Sports Medicine, and becoming a certified Athletic Trainer.  After working as a trainer for a while, I decided to further my education by studying Chiropractic Medicine.  I again furthered my understanding of the human body and its working as a Neurophysiologist.  Unlike most other physicians, I have 25 years of experience with sports, chiropractic medicine, and in the operating room.  I understand the role chiropractic has in helping people, but I understand the role of surgery as well, and work with orthopedic and neuro surgeons in helping patients receive the best possible care for their injury. My unique background makes me qualified to help others recover from injury and establish a healthy lifestyle.  I understand that no two injuries are exactly the same, and that every individual requires a treatment designed specifically to their circumstances so that they might feel at their optimal best."

#### Testimonials Section
**Heading:** "What People Are Saying About Dr. Phil"

**Testimonial 1 - Melissa M.:**
"I had tweaked my lower back and could barely walk. It was extremely painful and I couldn't stretch it out on my own. Phil (Dr. Wilkins) was able to adjust my lower back and get me walking again with no pain with only a couple of treatments. I would highly recommend him!"

**Testimonial 2 - Ashlee E.:**
"I have been going to Phil for years in which he has helped me with knee, neck, and back injuries and pain. He is always thorough and makes sure that he has helped relieve your pain and at the exact area that is being affected before he is done. He never tells you just how many times you need to see him before you're better, but always says, 'I'm here if you're still hurting', which is so different from other chiropractors I've been to. I can't recommend Phil enough."

**Testimonial 3 - Kolt E.:**
"Dr. Phil has worked miracles for my family several times! I was so impressed that a Chiropractor would come to my house and adjust my back after suffering an injury from playing basketball. He is very professional and takes the time to educate and make sure you are feeling better right away."

**Testimonial 4 - Crystal P:**
"I would highly recommend Phil for chiropractic needs! He is so knowledgeable with his background in the medical field. He has helped me out so much with my athletic injuries and also my SI joint fusion. Phil is amazing and your guy!!!"

### Why House Calls Page Content

**Page Title:** "Why House Calls"

**Background Image:** DSC_0019-scaled.jpg

**Content (3 Paragraphs):**

**Paragraph 1:**
"If you are looking for a level of convenience that you've never experienced, then House Calls is your answer. As a House Call Chiropractic Physician, I come to you. This means that you continue relaxing in the comfort of your own home or office while receiving quality care. There is no need to be inconvenienced by packing up the family, taking time off of work, driving and dealing with traffic, and sitting in waiting rooms. Why waste your precious valuable time when you could be doing the things you'd rather be doing?"

**Paragraph 2:**
"In a conventional office setting, it's not uncommon or unusual to sit in a waiting room for 20+ minutes, finally to be escorted to a treatment room where you once again wait for the doctor, who then ends up spending 5 minutes with you. You will receive more services and your care will be personalized to you so you can feel better faster. Dr. Phil is able to assess you on a deeper level in your home, so instead of treating your symptoms, He treats you as a whole."

**Paragraph 3:**
"Most people don't have time to go to the doctor and appointment times are difficult to manage. That's why House Calls are the solution. Let Chiropractic treatment come to you so you can feel better faster without the hassle."

## Technology Implementation Details

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/components/Testimonials.tsx
import { Carousel, CarouselContent, CarouselItem, CarouselNext, CarouselPrevious } from "@/components/ui/carousel";
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card";

const testimonials = [
  {
    name: "Melissa M.",
    text: "Dr. Phil's care changed my life. The convenience of house calls made it easy to stick with treatment.",
    date: "2024"
  },
  // ... more testimonials
];

export function Testimonials() {
  return (
    <Carousel>
      <CarouselContent>
        {testimonials.map((testimonial) => (
          <CarouselItem key={testimonial.name} className="md:basis-1/2 lg:basis-1/3">
            <Card>
              <CardContent className="p-6">
                <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">"{testimonial.text}"</p>
                <p className="font-semibold">{testimonial.name}</p>
              </CardContent>
            </Card>
          </CarouselItem>
        ))}
      </CarouselContent>
      <CarouselPrevious />
      <CarouselNext />
    </Carousel>
  );
}
```

### Google Maps Integration

  borderRadius: '12px'
};

const center = {
  lat: 40.4517, // Eagle Mountain, UT
  lng: -111.6246
};

export function ServiceAreaMap() {
  return (
    <LoadScript googleMapsApiKey={process.env.REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY!}>
      <GoogleMap mapContainerStyle={mapContainerStyle} center={center} zoom={10}>
        <Marker position={center} />

## Notes & Considerations

1. **JaneApp Integration:** All "Schedule Now" and "Free Consultation" CTAs should link to: http://drphilmobilechiro.janeapp.com/
2. **No Contact Form:** JaneApp handles all appointment booking - no custom form needed
3. **Testimonials:** 4 complete testimonials documented in Content Preservation section - use verbatim
4. **Images:** Hash-named files in scraped/images/full/ need to be identified and renamed to original names
5. **Background Images:** Use same backgrounds as original site (documented in each page section)
6. **Static Map:** Use existing service area map screenshot (Screen-Shot-2020-02-05-at-4.16.45-PM.png) - no Google Maps API
7. **Analytics:** Consider adding after launch
8. **Backup:** Keep original scraped HTML files in `/scraped` directory for reference
